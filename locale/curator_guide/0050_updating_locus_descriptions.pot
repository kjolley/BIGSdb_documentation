msgid "Loci in the sequence definitions database can have a description associated with them.  This may contain information about the gene product, the biochemical reaction it catalyzes, or publications providing more detailed information etc.  This description is accessible from various pages within the interface such as an :ref:`allele information page<allele_definition_records>` or from the :ref:`allele download page<download_alleles>`."

msgid "In recent versions of BIGSdb, a blank description record is created when a new locus is defined.  The following instructions assume that this is the case.  It is possible for this record to be deleted or it may never have existed if the locus was created using an old version of BIGSdb.  If the record does not exist, it can be added by clicking the Add (+) button in the 'locus descriptions' box.  Fill in the fields in the same way as described below."

Click the update/delete button in the 'locus descriptions' box on the sequence database curator's page (depending on the permissions set for your user account not all the links shown here may be displayed). This function is normally hidden, so you may need to click the 'Show all' toggle to display it."

An example of where it is appropriately used is where the locus name is an abbreviation, e.g. PorA_VR1 - here we could enter 'PorA variable region 1'.  This should not be used for the 'common name' of the locus (which is defined within the locus record itself) or the gene product."
