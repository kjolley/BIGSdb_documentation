"LINtree is a tool to infer prefix trees with branch lengths from sets of "
"Life Identification Number® (LIN) (trademark registered by This Genomic "
"Life, Inc., Floyd, VA, USA) codes. Such LIN-based prefix trees are very "
"useful to reflect the phylogenetic relationships among genomes typed by "
"cgMLST where LIN codes have been assigned. Once the tree has been "
"generated, the resultant Newick file is uploaded to iTOL for "
"visualisation (if enabled) along with selected metadata that can be used "
